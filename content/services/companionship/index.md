Our companionship services include;

## General company and conversation

Social interaction is important for everybody, but becomes even more so at an advanced age. It helps to combat loneliness, stimulates the mind, and provides emotional support, helping seniors still feel a sense of independence and self-worth, as well as helping to reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Our team are all passionate about ensuring the mental well-being of our clients, and more importantly they enjoy connecting with them, who doesn’t love a good chat?

## Facilitating hobbies & interests

We aim to facilitate and if possible enhance any hobbies our clients may have. Trips to anything from bowls to bridge clubs can easily be accommodated as well as regularly attending singing groups. In the home we can assist with crafts, jigsaws etc. Identifying and fitting in with the preferences of clients is vey important to us.

## Caring for pets

Many home settings involve more than just people. We recognise pets are often a very important part of the fabric of many peoples lives and therefore we aim to preserve any companionship bonds they provide. As such we can cater for the requirements of any pets in our care packages. This includes feeding, walking and trips to vets/groomers etc.
